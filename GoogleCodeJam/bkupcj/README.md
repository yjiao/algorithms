# Google Code Jam Submissions
This folder contains scripts written during [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/). The code provided are the same as those submitted during competition or practice, and thus contain macros to expedite writing due to time constraints during competition. File names are in the format `[year]_[round]_[problem].[cpp/py]`.
