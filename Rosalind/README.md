# Rosalind Algorithms Solutions
This folder contains scripts solving all problems in the [Rosalind Algorithmic-Heights track](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=algorithmic-heights). Rosalind is an online judge geared towards learning algorithms with a bioinformatic bent. However, its Algorithm-Heights track provides practice for many basic algorithms. 

All files in this folder are C++ files, written as a refresher for algorithms competitions. Because these are written as practice for competitions, they use the same C++ template as my competition entries, and thus contain macros to expedite writing in anticipation of competition time constraints.

## History
