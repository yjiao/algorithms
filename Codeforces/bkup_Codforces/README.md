# Codeforces Contest Submissions
This folder contains scripts written during [Codeforces algorithms competitions](codeforces.com). The code provided are the same as those submitted during competition or during practice, and thus contain macros to expedite writing due to time constraints during competition.

* **Practice problems** are named in the format `[Estimated Problem Difficulty]_[ContestID][ProblemID].[cpp/py]`. Estimated problem difficulty were calculated via [a separate project](https://github.com/chenmarkGH/codeforces-api). Problem difficulties can be roughly equated to user ratings in Codeforces, with larger numbers indicating higher difficulty.

* **Contest submissions** are named as `[ContestID][ProblemID].[cpp/py]`.
