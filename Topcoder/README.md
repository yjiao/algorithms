# Topcoder Contest Submissions
This folder contains scripts written during [topcoder SRMs](https://www.topcoder.com/member-onboarding/competing-in-an-algorithm-match-srm/) (single round matches). Problem descriptions are contained in txt files. C++ code submitted are in the matching .cpp files with the same prefix. The code provided are the same as those submitted during competition, and thus contain macros to expedite writing due to time constraints during competition.

## Credits
The topcoder plugin [TesterDream](http://fusharblog.com/apps/testerdream/) was used during topcoder SRMs, which automatically generates .txt files for the problem statements and allows editing with your editor of choice instead of the arena applet.

Scripts were written by [yj12](https://www.topcoder.com/members/yj12/details/?track=DATA_SCIENCE&subTrack=SRM).
