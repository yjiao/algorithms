PROBLEM STATEMENT
Elly's two little cousins are visiting her for the holidays.
As you may know, children love candy, so Elly has bought several boxes of sweets for them.
Each box contained an assorted collection of candy of different types.



At some point Elly realized that giving each child some of the boxes is not a good idea:
if they receive different candies, it will certainly cause a quarrel.
Therefore, Elly decided to open all the boxes, take out all the sweets and distribute them evenly into two plastic bags.



Of course, distributing a pile of assorted candies evenly may not always be possible.
Sometimes it happens that the number of pieces of some particular type of candy is odd.
In that case Elly will eat one of those sweets and only then will she distribute the rest of them evenly into the bags.



You are given the vector <string> boxes.
Each element of boxes describes the contents of one of the boxes Elly bought.
Each character in each element of boxes represents one piece of candy.
Equal characters are candies of the same type: e.g., all 'B's are identical bonbons and all 'L's are identical lollipops.



Compute and return the number of candies each child will receive.
