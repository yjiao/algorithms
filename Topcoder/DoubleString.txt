PROBLEM STATEMENT
A string is called a square if it can be created by concatenating two copies of the same string.
For example, "CANCAN" is a square because it consists of two copies of the string "CAN".
Other squares include "AA", "ZZZZ", and "BERIBERI".
The strings "AAAAA" and "HAHAHA" are not squares.

You are given a string S.
Return "square" (quotes for clarity) if there is a string T such that S = T + T.
Otherwise, return "not square".
Note that the return value is case-sensitive.

DEFINITION
Class:DoubleString
Method:check
Parameters:string
Returns:string
Method signature:string check(string S)


CONSTRAINTS
-The length of S will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.
-Each character in S will be an uppercase letter ('A'-'Z').


EXAMPLES

0)
"MAZAIMAZAI"

Returns: "square"

If T is "MAZAI", T+T will be "MAZAIMAZAI". 

1)
"MAMAZAIZAI"

Returns: "not square"

In this case, there is no string T for which T+T will be S.

2)
"IOI"

Returns: "not square"

The length of S is odd, so it's impossible to make S by concatenating the same string twice.

3)
"AA"

Returns: "square"

T will be "A".

4)
"ABCCBA"

Returns: "not square"



5)
"Y"

Returns: "not square"
