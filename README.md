# Topcoder Contest Submissions
This repository contains scripts written for various programming competitions (Topcoder SRMs, Codeforces, and Google Code Jam) and online judges (Rosalind). Because the code provided are the same as those submitted during competition or for competition practice, they contain macros to expedite writing due to time constraints during competitions. Due to the time limit during competitions, they are also minimally commented.
